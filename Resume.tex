During the course of summer '17 we worked on a project involving prediction of side effects using existing data (SIDER4) by leveraging machine learning with statistical data analysis. The entire work has been consolidated, documented \& open-sourced on github ({\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/drugADR}{\color{blue}drugADR}}).

\section{\sc Selected Projects}
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/VQAMD}{\color{blue} VQAMD}}}\\
A semester long project based on the Virginia Tech's {\href{http://visualqa.org/}{\color{blue} VQA}} (Version 2). Idea is to design a CNN + LSTM based model whose outputs are passed through a fully connected followed by softmax layer to improvise the overall accuracy on v2 release of VQA. The entire methodology is documented under a blog- {\bf {\href{http://www.swadhwa.me/blog/2018/01/01/de/}{\color{blue} Visual Question Answering through Modal Dialogue}}}\\
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/drugADR}{\color{blue} drugADR}}}\\
An open sourced consolidated version of the work done during my Summer Internship at IIIT-Delhi. The idea behind this research project was to leverage machine learning to predict phenotypic side effects of drugs using their chemcical properties.\\
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/Kaggle}{\color{blue} Kaggle-Repository}*}}\\
A collection of kernels (written in IPython Notebooks \& scripts) designed from datasets obtained from Kaggle for practise as well as competitions. These include implementations of typical Machine Learning algorithms on a range of datasets.\\
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/TheTwitterPolice}{\color{blue} TheTwitterPolice}}}\\
Analysis of law enforcement activity on Twitter in India. Collected data from five different police social handles (BeautifulSoup \& Selenium), stored them in a database (MongoDB), analysed (sentiment-analysis, time-series etc) \& displayed the results graphically in the form of a web-app (flask application deployed on heroku).\\
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/Image-Apportionor}{\color{blue} Image Apportionor}}}\\
A simple clustering based image segmentation in Python. Implemented k-means clustering for segmentation \& achieved a compression ratio of approximately 6.\\
\textit{*Ongoing}\\
All my projects (above included) are be available on {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa}{\color{blue}GitHub}}
