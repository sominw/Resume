Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology \hfill CPI: {\bf 79.2\%}\\
Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, India

\section{\sc Recent Experience}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item {\bf Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIIT-D)}\\
\textit{Research Intern} \hfill July, 2018 - Present\\
Complex Systems Lab, Center for Computational Biology \hfill June 2017 - March 2018 \\  
{\bf Advisor}: {\href{https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=qyth_0QAAAAJ&hl=en}{\underline{Dr. Ganesh Bagler}}}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item {\bf Current Work:} My current work focuses on creation of \textit{``BitterSweet: A resource to explore and predict taste information in small molecules"}. ({\href{http://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/bittersweet/}{http://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/bittersweet}})
\item {\bf Previous Work:} During my undergraduate studies, we worked on devising new methods to predict phenotypic side effects of drugs using existing data (SIDER4). The work was culminated in the form of a research article and the code was documented \& open-sourced on Github ({\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/drugADR}{\underline{link}}}).
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), Govt. of India}\\
\textit{Research} \& \textit{Development Intern} \hfill October 2017 - March 2018\\  
{\bf Advisor}: Dr. N.H. Siddalingaswamy (Director, AICTE)
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item {\bf Work:} Lead a team of 5 and with a project budget of \$4600. We analysed AICTE's employment statistics dataset and developed dynamic analytic dashboards to aid AICTE in granting approvals to higher education institutions.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{\sc Selected Projects\\ \\ {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa}{\underline{github.com/sominwadhwa}}}}
All of my projects (including the following ones) are be available on {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa}{\underline{github.com/sominwadhwa}}}\\
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/VQAMD}{\color{blue} VQAMD}}}\\
A semester long project based on the Virginia Tech's {\href{http://visualqa.org/}{\color{blue} VQA}} (Version 2). Idea is to design a CNN + LSTM based model whose outputs are passed through a fully connected followed by softmax layer to improvise the overall accuracy on v2 release of VQA. The entire methodology is documented under a blog- {\bf {\href{http://www.swadhwa.me/blog/2018/01/01/de/}{\color{blue} Visual Question Answering through Modal Dialogue}}}\\
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/Kaggle}{\color{blue} Kaggle-Repository}*}}\\
A collection of kernels (written in IPython Notebooks \& scripts) designed from datasets obtained from Kaggle for practise as well as competitions. These include implementations of typical Machine Learning algorithms on a range of datasets.\\
{\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/TheTwitterPolice}{\color{blue} TheTwitterPolice}}}\\
Analysis of law enforcement activity on Twitter in India. Collected data from five different police social handles (BeautifulSoup \& Selenium), stored them in a database (MongoDB), analysed (sentiment-analysis, time-series etc) \& displayed the results graphically in the form of a web-app (flask application deployed on heroku).
