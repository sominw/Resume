\section{\sc Education}
{\bf Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science \& Engineering} \\
Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology \hfill  2014 -- 2018\\
Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, India \hfill \textit{CPI: {\bf 79.2\%}}

\section{\sc Recent Experience}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item {\bf Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIIT-D)}\\
\textit{Research Intern} \hfill July, 2018 - Present\\
Complex Systems Lab, Center for Computational Biology \hfill June 2017 - March 2018 \\  
{\bf Advisor}: {\href{https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=qyth_0QAAAAJ&hl=en}{\underline{Prof. Ganesh Bagler}}}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item {\bf Current Work:} My current work focuses on creation of \textit{``BitterSweet: A resource to explore and predict taste information in small molecules"}. ({\href{http://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/bittersweet/}{http://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/bittersweet}})
\item {\bf Previous Work:} Pursued an internship where I worked on devising new methods to predict phenotypic side effects of drugs using existing data (SIDER4 \& DrugBank). The problem was formulated as an extreme multiclass-multilabel classification problem with severe class imbalance in the datasets. The work conducted was culminated in the form of a research article (published) and the code was documented \& is now open-sourced on Github ({\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/drugADR}{\underline{code}}}).
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), Govt. of India}\\
\textit{Research} \& \textit{Development Intern} \hfill October 2017 - March 2018\\  
{\bf Advisor}: Dr. N.H. Siddalingaswamy (Director, AICTE)
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item {\bf Work:} Lead a team of 5 with a project budget of \$4600 (Rs. 300,000) sponsored by the Ministry of Human Resources Development, Government of India. We curated and analysed graduate employment statistics datasets of several years and developed dynamic analytic dashboards to aid AICTE in granting approvals to higher education institutions.

\section{\sc Selected Projects}
All of my projects (including the following) are available on {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa}{github.com/sominwadhwa}}\\
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item {\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/vqamd_floyd}{Visual Question Answering through Modal Dialogue}:}}\\
A semester long B.Tech project based on the application of \textit{\href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.01121.pdf}{\underline{Malinowski et al.}}} (CNN + LSTM based models) on v2 of the {\href{http://visualqa.org/}{\underline{VQA}}} dataset released in April 2017. I have also documented and made the entire process reproducible with a single click in the form of a \href{https://blog.floydhub.com/asking-questions-to-images-with-deep-learning/}{\underline{featured blog post}}. ({\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/vqamd_floyd}{\underline{code}}})
\item {\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/Kaggle}{Kaggle Repository}:}}\\
An ongoing (2+ years) collection of kernels (implemented using IPython notebooks) designed using datasets obtained from Kaggle for practise as well as competitions. Projects in this repository demonstrate the implementation of several algorithms and data visualization techniques. ({\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/Kaggle}{\underline{github-repo}}}, {\href{https://www.kaggle.com/sominwadhwa}{\underline{kaggle profile}}})
\item {\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/TheTwitterPolice}{TheTwitterPolice}:}}\\
A basic analysis \& visualization of the Indian law enforcement activity on Twitter. Collected data for different cities (BeautifulSoup \& Selenium), stored them in a database (MongoDB), analysed (sentiment analysis, basic statistics etc) \& displayed the results graphically through a flask web-app. ({\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/TheTwitterPolice}{\underline{code}}})
\item {\bf {\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/Image-Apportionor}{Image Apportionor}:}}\\
A simple clustering based image segmentation project. Implemented the k-means clustering algorithm, from scratch, in Python as part of the academic summer activity requirement in my sophomore year. ({\href{https://github.com/sominwadhwa/TheTwitterPolice}{\underline{code}}})
